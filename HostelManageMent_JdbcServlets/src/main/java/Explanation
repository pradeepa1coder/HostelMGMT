Project Title: Hostel Management System

Overview:
The Hostel Management System is a Java EE web application designed to facilitate efficient management of hostel-related operations.
 Leveraging technologies such as JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interactions and JSP (JavaServer Pages) for dynamic web content, 
 the system provides a user-friendly interface for various functionalities.

Key Features:

Dynamic Web Pages:

Utilizes JSP pages for dynamic content generation.
Pages include features for saving data, updating records, finding records by ID, fetching all records, deleting records by ID,
 and additional update functionalities.
Database Connectivity:

Establishes a connection to a MySQL database (jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306) using JDBC.
The database, named jdbc_servlets_crud, stores hostel-related information.
Usage:
Users can interact with the system through intuitive web pages, each serving a specific function. 
The system simplifies tasks such as data entry, retrieval, and modification, providing a seamless experience for hostel management.
